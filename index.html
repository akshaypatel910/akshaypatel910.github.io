<h2><ul><li>History of Covid 19</li></ul></h2>

Summary
• A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China on 31 December 2019.

• WHO is working 24/7 to analyse data, provide advice, coordinate with partners, help countries prepare, increase supplies and manage expert networks.

• The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020.

• On 11 February 2020, WHO announced a name for the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19.

• To stay up to date, follow @DrTedros and @WHO on Twitter, read WHO’s daily situation reports and news releases,  and watch our regular press conferences. More information about WHO's response in countries can also be found here. 

WHO, Gavi and UNICEF warn that disruption to routine vaccination leaves at least 80 million children at risk  

22 May 2020 

 COVID 19 is disrupting life-saving immunization services around the world, putting millions of children – in rich and poor countries alike – at risk of diseases like diphtheria, measles and polio. 

Provision of routine immunization services is substantially hindered in at least 68 countries and is likely to affect approximately 80 million children under the age of 1 living in these countries.

Since March 2020, routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a global scale that may be unprecedented since the inception of expanded programs on immunization (EPI) in the 1970s. 

The reasons for disrupted services vary. Some parents are reluctant to leave home because of restrictions on movement, lack of information or because they fear infection with the COVID-19 virus. And many health workers are unavailable because of restrictions on travel, or redeployment to COVID response duties,  even funding transportation to ensure outreach activities. And in Lao PDR, despite a national lockdown imposed in March, routine immunization in fixed sites continued with physical distancing measures in place.

<h2><ul><li>Signs & Symptoms</li></ul></h2>

Fever


Dry cough

Tiredness
COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.
Most common symptoms:
fever
dry cough
tiredness
Less common symptoms:
aches and pains
sore throat
diarrhoea
conjunctivitis
headache
loss of taste or smell
a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes
Serious symptoms:
difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
chest pain or pressure
loss of speech or movement
Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.
People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.
On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.

<h2><ul><li>Diagnosis, Prevention measures</li></ul></h2>

Prevention: Measures must be put in place to limit transmission of TB and COVID-19 in
congregate settings and health care facilities, as per WHO guidelines (5),(6). Although
modes of transmission of the two diseases are slightly different, administrative,
environmental and personal protection measures apply to both (e.g. basic infection
prevention and control, cough etiquette, patient triage). Provision of TB preventive
treatment should be maintained as much as possible.
Diagnosis: Accurate diagnostic tests are essential for both TB and COVID-19. Tests for
the two conditions are different and both should be made available for individuals
with respiratory symptoms, which may be similar for the two diseases. TB laboratory
networks have been established in countries with the support of WHO and
international partners. These networks as well as specimen transportation mechanisms
could also be used for COVID 19 diagnosis and surveillance.

<h2><ul><li>Statistics about Covid19</li></ul></h2>

Unsurprisingly, urban areas - which account for more than 90% of COVID-19 cases - are bearing the brunt of the pandemic. The Lockdown measures have reduced violence in countries with a relatively low homicide rate, such as Italy, but has had little or no impact on violence in countries with high levels of organized crime and gang violence driven homicide.

Meanwhile, efforts to eliminate extreme poverty are being set back immensely, with global poverty expected to increase for the first time since the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis.

<h2><ul><li>Research initiatives made to cure Covid19</li></ul></h2>

Technology has a bigger role to play in fighting today's coronavirus pandemic crisis than ever before, and medical research is one of the key areas where the technology giants can contribute significantly. Focusing on this, Eric Horvitz, the chief scientific officer at Microsoft, published details of a collaborative database of scholarly articles presented in a machine readable format, called COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). The CORD-19 database comprises over 29,000 scholarly articles on research done on the coronavirus family, with over 13,000 articles presented in full text and uploaded to the database in a format that can be read and processed by machines.
